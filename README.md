# RealTimeSocialMediaPipeline
RealTimeSocialMediaPipeline (Spark&amp;Kafka&amp;Facebook Graph API)

Real-Time Social Media Data Pipeline 
with Spark Streaming & Kafka 

Project Description:

In this project, students will design and implement a real-time data processing pipeline 
using Apache Spark Streaming and Apache Kafka to handle social media data. 
The objective is to simulate a real-world scenario where large volumes of unstructured data 
from platforms like Facebook or Twitter (X) are continuously collected, processed, and 
redistributed for real-time consumption. 
Project Workflow 

Data Ingestion & Filtering:  Use an appropriate API (e.g., Graph API) - Apply custom filtering logic to extract relevant posts (for example: filter 
by keywords or hashtags). 

Data Publishing: Publish the filtered posts into a Kafka topic. 
Data Processing:  Connect Spark Streaming to consume the filtered data from the Kafka topic. - Apply further transformation, enrichment, or aggregation in Spark (such as 
wordcount). 

Display the final posts in the console in real-time, formatted for easy reading.
